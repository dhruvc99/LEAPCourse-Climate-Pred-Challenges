## Project Summary
This project explores different approaches to clustering hurricane tracks in the North Atlantic and West Pacific basins. Building upon the methodology of Nakamura et al. (2009), we implement and compare various clustering algorithms including K-means, Gaussian Mixture Models, and Spectral Clustering. Our analysis examines how these different methods perform in identifying meaningful patterns in tropical cyclone behavior and briefly explores potential implications for climate change studies.

## Key Features
- Implementation of multiple clustering algorithms
- Comprehensive evaluation metrics
- Comparison between North Atlantic and West Pacific basins
- Analysis of cluster characteristics and trends

## Required Libraries
- xarray
- numpy
- matplotlib
- cartopy
- scikit-learn
- seaborn
- pandas
